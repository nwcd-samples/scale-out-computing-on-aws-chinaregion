The Scale Out Computing on AWS (SOCA) installer retrieves a number of third-party software packages (such as open source packages) from third-party servers at install-time or build-time ("External Dependencies").  The External Dependencies are subject to license terms that you must accept in order to use SOCA, including an Affero GPL license.
