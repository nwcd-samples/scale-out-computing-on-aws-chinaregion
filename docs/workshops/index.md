# About

Welcome to the AWS workshop and lab content portal for Scale-Out Computing on AWS! Here you will find a collection of workshops and other hands-on content aimed at helping you gain an understanding of how to deploy and operate an elastic, multiuser environment for computationally intensive workflows on the AWS Cloud.

The resources on this site include a collection of easy to follow instructions with examples, templates to help you get started and scripts automating tasks supporting the hands-on labs.  Prior expertise with AWS and HPC workloads is helpful but not required to complete the labs.
