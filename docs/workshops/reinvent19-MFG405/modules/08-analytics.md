# Lab 6: Explore Analytics Dashboard

## Step 1: Open Cluster Dashboard

Return to the cluster web UI and click on the **Analytics** section on the left sidebar.

## Step 2: Add Data to your Cluster

By default, job information is ingested by the analytics system on an hourly basis.

1. Log back into the **scheduler host** via SSH as `ec2-user` and run the follow command to force immediate ingestion into OpenSearch (formerly Elasticsearch):

    ```bash
    source /etc/environment; /apps/soca/$SOCA_CONFIGURATION/python/latest/bin/python3 /apps/soca/$SOCA_CONFIGURATION/cluster_analytics/job_tracking.py
    ```

## Step 3: Create Indexes

Since it's the first time you access this endpoint, you will need to configure your indexes.  
First, access Kibana URL and click "Explore on my Own"

Go under Management and Click Index Patterns

Create your first index by typing **pbsnodes***.

Click next, and then specify the Time Filter key (**timestamp**). Once done, click Create Index Pattern.

Repeat the same operation for **jobs*** index 

![](../../../imgs/ws-analytics-3.png)

This time,  select **start_iso** as time filter key.

Once your indexes are configured, go to Kibana, select "Discover" tab to start visualizing the data

### Index Information

|  | Cluster Node Information | Job Information |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ---------- | 
| Kibana Index Name       | pbsnodes         | jobs        | 
| Data ingestion       | /apps/soca/cluster_analytics/cluster_nodes_tracking.py         | /apps/soca/cluster_analytics/job_tracking.py        | 
| Recurrence     | 1 minute         | 1 hour **(note: job must be terminated to be shown on OpenSearch (formerly Elasticsearch))**       | 
| Data uploaded         | Host Info (status of provisioned host, lifecycle, memory, cpu etc ..)         | Job Info (allocated hardware, licenses, simulation cost, job owner, instance type ...)        | 
| Timestamp Key   | Use "timestamp" when you create the index for the first time         | use "start_iso" when you create the index for the first time        |

## Find the price for a given simulation

Each job comes with `estimated_price_ondemand` and `estimated_price_reserved` attributes which are calculated based on: `number of nodes * ( simulation_hours * instance_hourly_rate ) `
